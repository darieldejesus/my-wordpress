                                <p>I started when I was 14 years old. My first website was a simple login page on Dreamweaver and PHP and when it worked I was like "It's working but I have not idea how". After that, I spent my the rest of my adolescence learning and making websites like "F1C-utilidades" which was a website to provide tools for a video game and "Arterro" which was my firt commercial website I created for a furniture store.</p>
                                <p>In 2011, I started to work as a software developer in a local company and later, in early 2013 I started to work in an US company, making websites and migration platforms for international customers.</p>
                                <p>After several years, I created this blog for other self-taught developers like myself. I created it because I like to practice and teach what I learn, focusing on the practice more than the theory.</p>
                                <p>I usually spend my time listening to 80s Pop Rock, taking pictures with my Canon t2i and lerning new things.</p>
